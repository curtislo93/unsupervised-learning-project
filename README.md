# Machine Learning Project - Unsupervised Learning
## Project Overview/Goal
This project focuses on applying unsupervised learning techniques to a real-world dataset, "Wholesale Data." The primary objective is to use these techniques to gain insights from the data and effectively communicate these findings through data visualization tools.
The ultimate objective of this project is to extract valuable insights from the "Wholesale Data" dataset. These insights will be conveyed to stakeholders using apt visualizations and metrics. This approach empowers stakeholders to make informed business decisions based on the questions posed.

## Project Outcomes
Unsupervised Learning: Employ unsupervised learning methodologies on the "Wholesale Data" dataset. The project consists of four core phases:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis and Pre-processing.
2. KMeans Clustering.
3. Hierarchical Clustering.
4. Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

## Project Description

### Dataset
The project centers around the "Wholesale Data" dataset, which encompasses information regarding various products retailed by a grocery store.

### Tasks
1. Exploratory Data Analysis and Pre-processing:
- Import and cleanse the dataset.
- Analyze and visualize relationships among variables.
- Address missing values and outliers.
- Implement relevant feature engineering techniques.
2. Unsupervised Learning:
- Apply k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and PCA to the "Wholesale Data" dataset.
- Identify underlying patterns and group similar data points together.
- Determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Present insights through effective data visualizations.

## Project Goal

## Conclusion
By leveraging unsupervised learning techniques, this project aims to look at analyze the "Wholesale Data" dataset. The use of data visualization tools will aid in conveying these insights effectively, enabling stakeholders to make well-founded decisions.
